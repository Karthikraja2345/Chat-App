Difference Between RR and YY in Oracle

    YY: Assumes the same century as the current date.
    RR: Uses century logic based on the two-digit year and helps in smooth transition.


Date Format Patterns  (refer the WhatsApp)


STORE SET <filename> (with .sql(preferable) or .txt or .config or without extension)- Used to save the current settings of the session and it can be used for the future.
STORE SET DEFAULTENV -  default file to save the settings
STORE SET DEFAULTENV.OLD APPEND - we can add some more customised settings in the DEFAULTENV with the .OLD extension

START <filename> - to restore the customised settings which we saved before.
						(or)
@<fiename_with_path> 



Troubleshooting or switching the databases : 

SQLPLUS /NOLOG :
	-Used to start the SQLPLUS without connecting to the database. 
	-To run the sql scripts that do not require a database connection(e. g. environment settings).
	-To troubleshoot the connection issues before actually connecting.
CONNECT:
	-Used to connect to the specific user after running the SQLPLUS /NOLOG by CONNECT <username/password@database_name>


SET MARKUP HTML ON 
	-Used to print the output in the html format

SET MARKUP HTML ON PREFORMAT ON
	-Useful in maintaining the same space, intention. line breaks as in SQLPLUS(mostly for non-table structured format like log file) 

SET COLSEP <SYMBOLS> :
	-Used to separate the columns using the symbol specified
SET RECSEP [EACH(after every row) | WRAP(wrapped lines) | OFF(no separator)]:
	-Used to separate the records by specifying the above keywords.
SET UNDERLINE '<symbol>':
	-Used to give as underline for the columns' heading

The above three operations are worked when the PREFORMAT ON.
